1 BRIEF DESCRIPTION
We have three different learning algorithm implementations:
- TD Policy Iteration
- Sarsa(0) and Sarsa(lambda)
- A pre-final version of the TD Policy Iteration that was 
tested on the real poppy

The two first were tested on vrep as well as in a deterministic
state modeling ("mathematical" domain), but unfortunately not on a real poppy
robot due to hardware failiure (broken camera). The third is a pre-final version
that was tested on a real poppy, which was recorded (Images and Video/Demovideo.m4v).
"[Un]Tested" below refers to tested on a real poppy robot.
