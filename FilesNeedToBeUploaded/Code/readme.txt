1 BRIEF DESCRIPTION
We have three different policies:
- A pre-final version of the TD Policy Iteration was 
tested on the real poppy
- The others could not be tested, as the camera broke
in the last week.

Untested means, they were not tested on the real poppy,
but on vrep as well as in the mathematical domain.
